Данный датасет содержит негативные (label = 1) и нейтральные (label = 0) высказывания.\n","Для работы объединим train_df и test_df.\n","\n","Задания:\n","\n","1) Заменим html-сущности (к примеру: &lt; &gt; &amp;). \"&lt;\" заменим на “<” и \"&amp;\" заменим на “&”)\"\"\". Сделаем это с помощью HTMLParser.unescape(). Всю предобработку делаем в новом столбце 'clean_tweet'\n","\n","2) Удалим @user из всех твитов с помощью паттерна \"@[\\w]*\". Для этого создадим функцию: \n"," - для того, чтобы найти все вхождения паттерна в тексте, необходимо использовать re.findall(pattern, input_txt)\n"," - для для замены @user на пробел, необходимо использовать re.sub()\n","при применении функции необходимо использовать np.vectorize(function).\n","\n","3) Изменим регистр твитов на нижний с помощью .lower().\n","\n","4) Заменим сокращения с апострофами (пример: ain't, can't) на пробел, используя apostrophe_dict. Для этого необходимо сделать функцию: для каждого слова в тексте проверить (for word in text.split()), если слово есть в словаре apostrophe_dict в качестве ключа (сокращенного слова), то заменить ключ на значение (полную версию слова).\n","\n","5) Заменим сокращения на их полные формы, используя short_word_dict. Для этого воспользуемся функцией, используемой в предыдущем пункте.\n","\n","6) Заменим эмотиконы (пример: \":)\" = \"happy\") на пробелы, используя emoticon_dict. Для этого воспользуемся функцией, используемой в предыдущем пункте.\n","\n","7) Заменим пунктуацию на пробелы, используя re.sub() и паттерн r'[^\\w\\s]'.\n","\n","8) Заменим спец. символы на пробелы, используя re.sub() и паттерн r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]'.\n","\n","9) Заменим числа на пробелы, используя re.sub() и паттерн r'[^a-zA-Z]'.\n","\n","10) Удалим из текста слова длиной в 1 символ, используя ' '.join([w for w in x.split() if len(w)>1]).\n","\n","11) Поделим твиты на токены с помощью nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize, создав новый столбец 'tweet_token'.\n","\n","12) Удалим стоп-слова из токенов, используя nltk.corpus.stopwords. Создадим столбец 'tweet_token_filtered' без стоп-слов.\n","\n","13) Применим стемминг к токенам с помощью nltk.stem.PorterStemmer. Создадим столбец 'tweet_stemmed' после применения стемминга.\n","\n","14) Применим лемматизацию к токенам с помощью nltk.stem.wordnet.WordNetLemmatizer. Создадим столбец 'tweet_lemmatized' после применения лемматизации.\n","\n","15) Сохраним результат предобработки в
